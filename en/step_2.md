## Import your costumes

--- task ---
Using the default cat sprite, start by adding some more costumes. You'll need to import at least forty different costumes into your sprite.

It's best to select costumes from the **People** section, but the choice is yours.

Once you have your costumes, you can delete the default cat costumes if you like.
