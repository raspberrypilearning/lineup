## Changing the costumes

- Let's change the stamp each time and make it a more appropriate size.

- When you run the script, you should see something like this:

- At the moment, your program cycles through all the costumes in order. This isn't a problem, so long as you place the sprite in a random location each time.

- To do this, you'll need to follow the following **algorithm**:
  1. Set `index` to a random number between `1` and the length of a list
  2. Move the sprite as you did before
  3. Delete the `index` position from the `y_positions` list
  4. Delete the `index` position from the `x_positions` list
  
- Have a go at doing this part yourself, and take a look at the hints if you need some help.
