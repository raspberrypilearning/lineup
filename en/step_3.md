## Import your costumes

- Using the default cat sprite, start by adding some more costumes.

- For this game you will need a **lot** of costumes. You'll want to import at least 40 costumes from the Scratch library.

- It's best to select costumes from the **People** section, but the choice is yours.

- Once you have your costumes, you can delete the default cat costumes if you like.
