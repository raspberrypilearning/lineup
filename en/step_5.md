## Stamp a row

So far you have ten values in each of the two lists. Now stamp some costumes at the Stage coordinates stored in the lists.

Add the **Pen** extension to your project.

Create a new block and call it `stamp sprites`{:class="block3myblocks"}. This block needs two number inputs named `row`{:class="block3myblocks"} and `columns`{:class="block3myblocks"} just like the other custom block.

```blocks3
define stamp sprites (rows) (columns)
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Create a new variable called `index`{:class="block3variables"} with which to track the position in the lists that your program is reading. To begin with, set `index`{:class="block3variables"} to `1`{:class="block3variables"} to fetch the first item of each list.

```blocks3
define stamp sprites (rows) (columns)
+ set [index v] to [1]
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

The `stamp sprites`{:class="block3myblocks"} block should stamp a sprite for each pair of coordinates in the list. To do this, the block needs a `repeat`{:class="block3variables"} loop that runs once for each column.

```blocks3
define stamp sprites (rows) (columns)
set [index v] to [1]
+ repeat (columns :: custom-arg)
```

--- /task ---	

--- task ---

Within the `repeat`{:class="block3variables"} loop:
 - Move the sprite to the `index`{:class="block3variables"} position in the `x_positions`{:class="block3variables"} and `y_positions`{:class="block3variables"} lists
 - `Stamp`{:class="block3extensions"} the sprite
 - Change the `index`{:class="block3variables"} by `1`{:class="block3variables"}

Within the `repeat`{:class="block3variables"} loop, add a `go to x: y:`{:class="block3motion"} block. The `x`{:class="block3motion"} position in this block should be set to the `index`{:class="block3variables"} of `x_positions`{:class="block3variables"} and the `y`{:class="block3motion"} position should be set to the `index`{:class="block3variables"} of `y_positions`{:class="block3variables"}. Then add code to `stamp`{:class="block3extensions"} the sprite. Finally, add code to increase `index`{:class="block3variables"} by 1.

Here are the blocks you need:

```blocks3
define stamp sprites (rows) (columns)
set [index v] to [1]
repeat (columns :: custom-arg)
end

change [index v] by (1)
(index) 
(index) 
go to x: () y: ()
(item ()of [y_positions v])
(item ()of [x_positions v])
stamp
```

Here is the completed script for the `stamp sprites`{:class="block3myblocks"} block:

```blocks3
define stamp sprites (rows) (columns)
set [index v] to [1]
repeat (columns :: custom-arg)
+ go to x: (item (index) of [x_positions v]) y: (item (index) of [y_positions v]
+ stamp
+ change [index v] by (1)
```

Add a `erase all`{:class="block3extensions"} block below the `when flag clicked`{:class="block3control"} block to clear the Stage each time the game starts. Then add the `stamp sprites`{:class="block3myblocks"} block at the bottom of the `when flag clicked`{:class="block3control"} script so you can test your new code.

```blocks3
when flag clicked
erase all
generate positions (1) (10) ::custom
stamp sprite (1) (10) ::custom
```

Click the green flag. You should see something like this, depending on the costumes your sprite has:
