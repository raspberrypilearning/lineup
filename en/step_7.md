## Adding rows

- Now that you've written the code to generate a single row, you need to add in more rows.

- Go back to your `generate positions` block.

- Now you need another loop that will repeat the same number of times as the number of rows you need. Place it into your script as shown below.

- Next you need to increase the value of `y_pos`. This will increase up to a maximum of `150`, which is `300` away from its starting value of `-150`. This needs to happen for each row your create.

- Then you need to make sure you're passing the number of `rows` as a parameter to your blocks.

- If you run your code now, you won't get a neat grid of stamps.

- This is because your `stamp sprite` block is only repeating for the total number of columns. It needs to repeat for the product of the number of columns and the number of rows (`columns * rows`).
