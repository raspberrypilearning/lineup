## Introduction

In this project you will be making a game using Scratch 2.0. The game will involve finding a stamped sprite on the stage, hidden amongst a huge group of other stamps.

### What you will make

Here's an example of the game you will make:

<iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="//scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/170916029/?autostart=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Hit the green flag and, once the curtain has been raised, try and find the clone before your time runs out.

### What you will learn

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Apply basic programming constructs to solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)
