## Challenge: Taking it further
Here are some ideas for further additions to your game that could make it more interesting.
- Can you alter your scripts so that you can use even more costumes?
- How about choosing a background and then making the sprites nearer the top of the screen appear smaller, so they seem further away?
- Can you make the game repeat, and provide you with a score based on your time to complete five attempts?
